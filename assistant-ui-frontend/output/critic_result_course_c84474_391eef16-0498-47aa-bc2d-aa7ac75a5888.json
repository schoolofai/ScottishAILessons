The SoW teaches foundational 'Numeracy' topics (fractions, percentages, speed/distance/time) but incorrectly maps them to assessment standards (AS1.1, AS1.2, AS1.3) from the 'Managing Finance and Statistics' unit.

  "feedback": "The Scheme of Work fails its validation. While it demonstrates outstanding quality in several areas—notably its logical sequencing, consistent policy application, excellent accessibility features, and superb use of authentic Scottish contexts—it has critical failures in Coverage and Authenticity that prevent it from passing.\n\nThe primary issue is a fundamental mismatch between the content being taught (Numeracy) and the official SQA assessment standards being referenced (from Managing Finance and Statistics). This error invalidates the pedagogical mapping of the lessons. Furthermore, the SoW has severe coverage gaps, failing to include the vast majority of the course curriculum and missing mandatory lesson types like 'independent_practice' and 'mock_assessment'. Finally, the lesson plans themselves are too shallow, with all entries falling short of the required 6-12 card depth, and one lesson contains a timing calculation error. \n\nTo pass, the SoW requires urgent correction of the standard mapping, expansion of lesson plan depth, and a significant increase in overall course coverage.",
