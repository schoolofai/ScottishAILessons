# Replit Environment Variables Template
# =====================================================
#
# This file is a TEMPLATE showing all required environment variables.
# DO NOT put actual secrets in this file!
#
# Instead, add these to Replit Secrets (padlock icon in left sidebar):
# 1. Click the padlock icon
# 2. Add each variable as a key-value pair
# 3. Secrets are encrypted and injected at runtime
#
# =====================================================

# =====================================
# Backend APIs (BOTH REQUIRED - CRITICAL)
# =====================================
# The frontend requires TWO backends - both will be deployed to LangGraph Platform
# Frontend will show error until BOTH backends are properly configured

# Main Backend: Teaching sessions, lessons, course management
# Deploy from: langgraph-agent/ directory
# This MUST be updated when you deploy the main backend to LangGraph Platform
NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGGRAPH_API_URL=https://placeholder-main-backend.langchain.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGGRAPH_ASSISTANT_ID=agent

# Context Chat Backend: AI Tutor side panel for contextual help during lessons
# Deploy from: langgraph-generic-chat/ directory
# This MUST be updated when you deploy the context chat backend to LangGraph Platform
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTEXT_CHAT_API_URL=https://placeholder-context-chat.langchain.app

# =====================================
# Appwrite Authentication (Cloud Service)
# =====================================
# These connect to Appwrite Cloud - should work immediately
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=68adb98e0020be2e134f

# Server-side Appwrite API key (ADD TO SECRETS - do not expose in client)
# Get this from: Appwrite Console > Settings > API Keys
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-appwrite-api-key-here

# =====================================
# Application Configuration
# =====================================
# Update this to your actual Replit URL after deployment
# Format: https://[your-repl-name].[your-username].repl.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app-url.replit.app

# Node environment (production for deployed apps)
NODE_ENV=production

# =====================================
# AI Model API Keys (ADD TO SECRETS)
# =====================================
# OpenAI API Key (required for GPT models)
# Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here

# Anthropic API Key (if using Claude models)
# Get from: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-anthropic-key-here

# =====================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES
# =====================================
#
# 1. NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are exposed to the browser
#    - Only use for non-sensitive configuration
#    - API URLs are okay to expose
#
# 2. Server-only secrets (without NEXT_PUBLIC_):
#    - APPWRITE_API_KEY
#    - OPENAI_API_KEY
#    - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
#    These are NOT exposed to the browser (safe for server-side use)
#
# 3. When backends are deployed to LangGraph Platform:
#    - Update NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGGRAPH_API_URL to main backend URL (*.langchain.app)
#    - Update NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTEXT_CHAT_API_URL to context chat backend URL (*.langchain.app)
#    - Update NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL to your Replit frontend URL
#    - Restart the frontend deployment
#    - BOTH backend URLs are REQUIRED for full functionality
#
# 4. After deployment, update Appwrite OAuth callbacks:
#    - Go to Appwrite Console > Your Project > Settings
#    - Add: https://[your-repl-url]/api/auth/callback
#
