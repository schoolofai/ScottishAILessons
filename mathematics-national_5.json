    "guidance": "General Marking Principles for National 5 Mathematics\n\nMarkers must always apply these general principles in conjunction with the detailed marking instructions for each question.\n\n1. Positive Marking:\n   * Issue: Ensuring candidates are awarded for demonstrated skills, knowledge, and understanding, rather than penalising for errors.\n   * Instructions to Markers: Always use positive marking. Candidates accumulate marks for correct demonstrations; marks are never deducted for errors or omissions.\n\n2. Seeking Guidance:\n   * Issue: Encountering candidate responses not explicitly covered by general principles or detailed marking instructions.\n   * Instructions to Markers: If uncertain how to assess a specific response, seek guidance from your team leader.\n\n3. Mark Allocation:\n   * Issue: Understanding the value of each marking point.\n   * Instructions to Markers: One mark is available for each bullet point (•). There are no half marks.\n\n4. Error Handling (Follow-through Marking):\n   * Issue: How to mark subsequent working after an initial error.\n   * Instructions to Markers: If a candidate's response contains an error, all subsequent working must still be marked. Award marks only if the level of difficulty in the subsequent working is similar to the level of difficulty in the illustrative scheme.\n\n5. Working Required for Full Marks:\n   * Issue: Awarding marks for correct answers without supporting working.\n   * Instructions to Markers: Only award full marks where the solution contains appropriate working. A correct answer with no working receives no mark, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the marking instructions for that specific question.\n\n6. Permitted Methods:\n   * Issue: Candidates using alternative, mathematically correct methods.\n   * Instructions to Markers: Candidates may use any mathematically correct method to answer questions, except in cases where a particular method is specified or explicitly excluded.\n\n7. Trivial Errors:\n   * Issue: Minor calculation errors (e.g., 6 x 6 = 12).\n   * Instructions to Markers: If an error is trivial, casual, or insignificant, candidates lose the opportunity to gain a mark. An exception is made for transcription errors where the candidate deals with the intended quadratic equation, in which case all marks may be awarded (see point 8).\n\n8. Transcription Errors:\n   * Issue: Errors made when copying from the question paper to the script, or within the script.\n   * Examples:\n     * Candidate writes x² + 5x + 7 = 9x + 4 as x - 4x + 3 = 0. This is a transcription error.\n     * Candidate then solves x - 4x + 3 = 0 as x = 1. This is no longer a quadratic equation.\n   * Instructions to Markers: If a candidate makes a transcription error, they lose the opportunity to gain the next process mark. However, if the candidate deals with the intended quadratic equation despite a transcription error (e.g., x² + 5x + 7 = 9x + 4 becomes x² - 4x + 3 = 0 and then correctly factorised to (x-3)(x-1)=0), this error is not treated as a transcription error, and all marks may be awarded.\n\n9. Horizontal/Vertical Marking for Paired Solutions:\n   * Issue: Questions requiring two pairs of solutions (e.g., simultaneous equations).\n   * Example: Solutions are x=2, y=5 and x=-4, y=-7.\n   * Instructions to Markers: If a question results in two pairs of solutions, apply horizontal or vertical marking as indicated in the detailed marking instructions. Choose whichever method benefits the candidate, do not combine both.\n     * Horizontal: Mark x=2 and x=-4 together, then y=5 and y=-7 together.\n     * Vertical: Mark x=2 and y=5 together, then x=-4 and y=-7 together.\n\n10. Simplification of Final Answers:\n    * Issue: Numerical values in final answers.\n    * Instructions to Markers: Candidates should simplify numerical values as far as possible unless specifically mentioned in the detailed marking instructions. For example, 15/12 should be simplified to 5/4 or 1 1/4. √64 must be simplified to 8. Square roots of perfect squares up to and including 144 must be known.\n\n11. 'Show that...' Questions:\n    * Issue: Candidates needing to arrive at a required result.\n    * Instructions to Markers: In 'Show that...' questions, the last mark is not awarded as a follow-through from a previous error, unless explicitly specified in the detailed marking instructions.\n\n12. Checking All Working:\n    * Issue: Fundamental misunderstandings appearing early in a response.\n    * Instructions to Markers: Check all working carefully. Even with an early misunderstanding, marks may still be awarded later in the question. The appearance of a correct answer does not guarantee all available marks.\n\n13. Scored-out Working:\n    * Issue: How to treat scored-out working.\n    * Instructions to Markers: Mark legible scored-out working that has not been replaced. If scored-out working has been replaced, only mark the replacement working.\n\n14. Multiple Attempts:\n    * Issue: Candidates making multiple attempts at a question.\n    * Instructions to Markers:\n      * If multiple attempts use the same strategy and the final answer is not identified, mark all attempts and award the lowest mark.\n      * If candidates try different valid strategies, apply the above rule to attempts within each strategy and then award the highest mark across strategies.\n      * Example: Strategy 1 attempts: 3 marks, 4 marks -> Resultant mark for Strategy 1 is 3. Strategy 2 attempts: 1 mark, 5 marks -> Resultant mark for Strategy 2 is 1. Overall award: 3 marks (highest of 3 and 1).\n\nAdditional Guidance from Course Reports (2022, 2023, 2024):\n\n*   Number Skills (Non-Calculator Paper):\n    *   Issue: Candidates losing marks due to lack of basic number skills, especially in the non-calculator paper.\n    *   Instructions to Markers: Emphasise the importance of maintaining and practising number skills for the non-calculator paper.\n*   Algebraic Skills:\n    *   Issue: Candidates losing marks due to lack of basic algebraic skills (rearranging, factorising, simplifying).\n    *   Instructions to Markers: Encourage consistent practice of basic algebraic skills across both papers.\n*   Premature Rounding:\n    *   Issue: Inappropriate premature rounding leading to incorrect final answers.\n    *   Instructions to Markers: Penalise premature rounding that affects the accuracy of the final answer. For example, rounding sin x = 2/3 to 0.7 too early will lead to incorrect angles.\n*   Diagram Annotation:\n    *   Issue: Candidates performing calculations elsewhere on the page without clearly attaching them to named angles in diagrams.\n    *   Instructions to Markers: Encourage candidates to note the sizes of any calculated angles directly on the diagram to ensure marks are awarded.\n*   Quadratic Graphs and Completing the Square:\n    *   Issue: Candidates not linking skills related to quadratic graphs (e.g., y = (x+a)²+b) with completing the square.\n    *   Instructions to Markers: Look for evidence of understanding the connection between these forms.\n*   Communication of Reasoning:\n    *   Issue: Candidates not providing valid comments when comparing data sets or not communicating final answers appropriately (e.g., leaving answers as m=0.8 instead of 'a mango costs £0.80').\n    *   Instructions to Markers: Award marks for clear communication of reasons and explanations, and for stating answers in context where appropriate.\n*   Pythagoras' Theorem and Right Angles:\n    *   Issue: Incorrectly applying Pythagoras' theorem to non-right-angled triangles or failing to mention the right angle in conclusions for converse Pythagoras questions.\n    *   Instructions to Markers: Ensure candidates demonstrate understanding of the conditions for applying Pythagoras' theorem and clearly state the presence of a right angle when using its converse.\n*   Trigonometric Identities:\n    *   Issue: Difficulty in identifying substitutions to eliminate terms (e.g., cos²x) or not laying out proofs in a structured way.\n    *   Instructions to Markers: Look for evidence of correct substitutions and logical steps in proofs.\n*   Volume Formulae:\n    *   Issue: Candidates forgetting basic volume formulae (e.g., cuboid) or using incorrect dimensions.\n    *   Instructions to Markers: Ensure correct formula application and use of appropriate dimensions.\n*   Nature of Roots:\n    *   Issue: Candidates not using correct terminology for the nature of roots of a quadratic function.\n    *   Instructions to Markers: Expected responses are:\n        *   b² - 4ac > 0: 'two real and distinct roots'\n        *   b² - 4ac = 0: 'one repeated real root' or 'two equal real roots'\n        *   b² - 4ac < 0: 'no real roots'\n*   Efficient Methods:\n    *   Issue: Candidates using less efficient methods, leading to errors or incomplete solutions.\n    *   Instructions to Markers: While any mathematically correct method is acceptable, encourage efficient strategies where appropriate."
