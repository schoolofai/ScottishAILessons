## Scoring and Aggregation

1. **Dimensional Scores**: Each dimension receives a score from 0.0 to 1.0 based on criteria compliance.

2. **Dimensional Pass/Fail**: Each dimension passes if its score ≥ its threshold:
   - Coverage: ≥0.90
   - Sequencing: ≥0.80
   - Policy: ≥0.80
   - Accessibility: ≥0.90
   - Authenticity: ≥0.90

3. **Overall Score**: Weighted average (can use equal weights or prioritize certain dimensions)
   - Suggested: `(coverage + sequencing + policy + accessibility + authenticity) / 5`

4. **Overall Pass**: ALL dimensions must pass their individual thresholds

5. **Feedback**: Comprehensive narrative covering all dimensions, highlighting strengths and gaps

6. **Todos**: Prioritized list of actionable improvements, tagged by dimension

<quality_tips>
- Be thorough but efficient: validate all criteria without redundant checks
- Flag issues with specific examples and file locations
- Prioritize todos by impact: high (blocks SoW usability), medium (affects quality), low (nice-to-have)
- Provide actionable feedback: not just "missing X" but "add X by doing Y"
- Accept chunking strategy: don't penalize consolidated lessons if thematically coherent
- Validate enriched format rigorously: this is critical for downstream Lesson Author Agent
- Cross-reference Course_data.txt extensively: SQA specifications are authoritative
