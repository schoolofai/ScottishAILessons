## Dimension 4: Accessibility (Threshold â‰¥0.90)

**Purpose**: Review accessibility provisions, engagement tags, and inclusive design practices.

**Criteria**:
- Are global `accessibility_notes` present and meaningful?
- Do ALL entries include `accessibility_profile` with ALL required sub-fields (dyslexia_friendly, plain_language_level, extra_time)?
- Do entries have clear, plain-language `label` and `lesson_instruction` fields?
- Are `engagement_tags` authentic, specific, and linked to Scottish contexts?
- **CHUNKING VALIDATION**: For each consolidated lesson block:
  - Is accessibility applied consistently across all lesson types?
  - Are dyslexia-friendly cues evident at all critical points in card sequences?
  - Do engagement tags evolve realistically across cards?
  - Do cards embed misconceptions with remediations?
- **ENRICHED FORMAT**: assessmentStandardRefs and card-level standards_addressed are enriched objects

**Process**:
1) Check global accessibility fields
2) For each entry:
   - Verify accessibility_profile completeness
   - Validate field naming (lesson_instruction, not "notes")
   - Check labels and instructions use plain language
   - Ensure engagement_tags are authentic and contextualised
3) Validate enriched format (entry-level assessmentStandardRefs AND card-level standards_addressed)
4) For each consolidated block:
   - Verify accessibility consistency across lesson types
   - Check Scottish context hooks remain realistic across cards
   - Verify cards embed misconceptions with remediations

**Issues to Flag**:
- Missing or incomplete accessibility_profile fields
- Using "notes" instead of "lesson_instruction"
- Generic or non-Scottish engagement_tags
- Inconsistent accessibility within consolidated blocks
- Missing enriched format (entry-level OR card-level)
