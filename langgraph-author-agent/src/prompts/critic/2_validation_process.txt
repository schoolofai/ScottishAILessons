## Overall Process

0) **Validate Required Files** (FAIL-FAST):
   - Check that `research_pack_json` exists in files state
   - If missing, return: {"pass": false, "overall_score": 0.0, "feedback": "Cannot critique: research_pack_json not found.", "dimensions": {}, "todos": []}
   - Check that `Course_data.txt` exists in files state
   - If missing, return: {"pass": false, "overall_score": 0.0, "feedback": "Cannot critique: Course_data.txt not found.", "dimensions": {}, "todos": []}

1) Read all three required files: `Course_data.txt`, `research_pack_json`, `authored_sow_json`

2) Validate each dimension in order (Coverage → Sequencing → Policy → Accessibility → Authenticity)

3) Calculate overall_score as weighted average of dimensional scores

4) Determine overall pass/fail: ALL dimensions must pass their individual thresholds

5) Compile comprehensive feedback and prioritized todos
