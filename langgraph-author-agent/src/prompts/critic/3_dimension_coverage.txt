<dimension_1_coverage>
## Dimension 1: Coverage (Threshold ≥0.90)

**Purpose**: Evaluate breadth and depth of coverage for all official SQA units, outcomes, and assessment standards.

**Criteria**:
- Does the SoW cover ALL official units from Course_data.txt (`course_structure.units[]`)?
- Does the SoW address ALL official outcomes from Course_data.txt (`outcomes[]`)?
- Are ALL assessment standards from Course_data.txt represented (either individually or within consolidated lesson blocks)?
- **CHUNKING ACCEPTANCE**: Accept that 2-3 (or up to 5) standards can be consolidated into unified lessons with thematic coherence.
- For each consolidated lesson block, is there a **multi-lesson sequence** that includes:
  * Mandatory teach→revision pairing (every teach lesson followed by revision lesson)
  * formative_assessment → independent_practice after teach→revision pairs
- **COURSE-LEVEL LESSON TYPE VALIDATION**:
  * Does the SoW include at least one independent_practice lesson? (for mock exam prep)
  * Does the SoW include exactly one mock_assessment lesson? (for real exam simulation)
- **ENRICHED FORMAT**: Are assessmentStandardRefs objects (NOT bare strings) with code, description (from Course_data.txt), and outcome fields?
- **LESSON PLAN DEPTH**: Does every entry have lesson_plan with detailed card_structure (6-12 cards)?
  * Are card fields complete (card_number, card_type, title, purpose, standards_addressed, pedagogical_approach, cfu_strategy, estimated_minutes)?
  * Do cards use enriched standards_addressed (code/description/outcome objects - NOT bare codes)?
  * For chunked lessons, do cards progressively scaffold ALL consolidated standards?
  * Are CFU strategies specific (not generic "ask questions")?
  * Do card timings sum to estMinutes?
- Does the SoW touch all major themes identified in the research pack?
- Are there enough entries for the intended time window (should be ~10-20 lessons, NOT 80-100)?
- Is there a realistic balance of lesson_type values?
- Are prerequisites and progression realistic?

**Process**:
1) Check coverage of ALL units
2) Check coverage of ALL outcomes
3) Check coverage of ALL assessment standards (accepting chunking/consolidation):
   - Each standard must appear in at least one entry's assessmentStandardRefs array
   - For each consolidated lesson block, confirm lesson sequence exists
4) Validate enriched format (assessmentStandardRefs are objects with code, description, outcome)
5) **NEW**: Validate lesson_plan presence and depth for EACH entry:
   - Extract lesson_plan.card_structure array
   - Count cards (must be 6-12 for realistic lesson)
   - For each card:
     * Verify all required fields present
     * Verify standards_addressed uses enriched objects (code/description/outcome) - NOT bare codes
     * Verify pedagogical_approach is detailed, not generic
     * Verify cfu_strategy is specific (not "ask questions")
     * Check misconceptions_addressed if relevant card type
   - Aggregate standards_addressed across all cards in lesson_plan
   - Compare to entry's assessmentStandardRefs: all standards must appear in at least 2-3 cards
   - Verify card timings sum to estMinutes (allow 5-min tolerance)
6) Check breadth: major themes from research pack represented
7) Check quantity: ~10-20 lessons (not 80-100)
8) Check balance: lesson_type cadence is varied
9) Validate lesson type requirements:
   - Count teach lessons vs revision lessons (must be 1:1 ratio)
   - Verify each teach lesson is paired with a revision lesson (teach→revision)
   - Count independent_practice lessons (must be ≥1 at course level)
   - Count mock_assessment lessons (must be exactly 1 at course level)

**Issues to Flag**:
- Missing units, outcomes, or assessment standards
- Incomplete lesson sequences for consolidated blocks
- Bare string codes instead of enriched objects (entry-level OR card-level)
- **NEW**: Shallow lesson plans (< 6 cards per entry)
- **NEW**: Missing or incomplete card fields (card_number, title, standards_addressed, etc.)
- **NEW**: Cards using bare codes in standards_addressed instead of enriched objects
- **NEW**: Poor standard mapping (cards don't address all consolidated standards)
- **NEW**: Unrealistic timing (cards sum to 15min for a 50min lesson)
- **NEW**: Generic CFU strategies ("ask questions" instead of specific prompts)
- Insufficient lesson count or imbalanced lesson types
- **NEW**: Teach→revision pairing violated (teach lesson without corresponding revision)
- **NEW**: Missing course-level independent_practice lesson (required for mock exam prep)
- **NEW**: Missing or multiple mock_assessment lessons (must be exactly 1)
