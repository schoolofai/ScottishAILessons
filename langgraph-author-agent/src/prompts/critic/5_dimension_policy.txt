## Dimension 3: Policy (Threshold ≥0.80)

**Purpose**: Ensure policy guardrails (calculator usage, assessment cadence, timing) align with official SQA assessment rules.

**Criteria**:
- Does calculator usage align with `assessment_model.calculator_policy` from Course_data.txt?
- Is calculator usage staged appropriately across the course (non_calc → mixed → calc)?
- **CHUNKING VALIDATION**: For each consolidated lesson block:
  - Are calculator rules consistent with official policy at each stage?
  - Do assessment notes appear in related entries?
  - Is policy applied consistently across all standards within the block?
- Does assessment cadence match `assessment_model.coursework_notes`?
- Are formative, revision, and summative assessments realistically distributed?
- Do `estMinutes` values align with Scottish classroom periods (25–50 minutes)?
- Are `metadata.policy_notes` honored?
- Does marking guidance from Course_data.txt inform assessment-aligned entries?
- **ENRICHED FORMAT**: assessmentStandardRefs are objects
- **LESSON PLAN PRESENCE**: Every entry has lesson_plan with detailed card structure
- **Field naming**: entries use lesson_instruction (NOT "notes")

**Process**:
1) Read official assessment model, calculator policy, and marking guidance
2) Validate calculator usage (global and block-level)
3) Validate assessment cadence (spacing, thresholds)
4) Validate timing (estMinutes realistic)
5) Validate marking guidance alignment
6) Validate enriched format, guidance, and field naming

**Issues to Flag**:
- Calculator usage doesn't align with official policy
- Assessment cadence violates coursework rules
- estMinutes values unrealistic
- Policy inconsistencies within consolidated blocks
- Missing enriched format or guidance
- Using "notes" instead of "lesson_instruction"
