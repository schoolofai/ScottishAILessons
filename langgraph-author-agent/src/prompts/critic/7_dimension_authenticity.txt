## Dimension 5: Authenticity (Threshold ≥0.90)

**Purpose**: Ensure Scottish classroom authenticity and proper SQA terminology usage.

**Criteria**:
- Does the SoW use exact unit titles from Course_data.txt?
- Are unit codes correctly referenced (e.g., "HV7Y 73")?
- Does the SoW use official outcome titles from Course_data.txt?
- Is assessment terminology aligned with Course_data.txt standards?
- **ENRICHED FORMAT**: Are assessmentStandardRefs objects with descriptions matching Course_data.txt exactly?
- **LESSON PLAN SCOTTISH CONTEXT CHECK**: Do ALL cards in lesson_plan use Scottish contexts?
  * For cards with worked_example or practice_problems, verify Scottish contexts (£, local shops, NHS)
  * Check lesson_plan.multi_standard_integration_strategy mentions authentic Scottish scenarios
  * Verify card titles and purposes use CfE/SQA terminology
  * Ensure card-level standards_addressed use enriched objects (code/description/outcome)
- **Field naming**: Do entries use `lesson_instruction` (NOT "notes")?
- Is CfE/SQA-specific language used correctly?
- Currency shown in £ not $ or €
- Contexts reflect Scotland (NHS, local councils, Scottish shops)
- Language consistent with CfE/SQA practice
- Entry lesson_instruction aligns with Scottish pedagogical approaches

**Process**:
1) Read official SQA terminology, unit titles, codes, outcomes, standards
2) Validate unit titles match exactly
3) Validate unit codes
4) Validate outcome titles
5) Validate assessment terminology
6) Validate enriched format (descriptions match Course_data.txt exactly - entry AND card level)
7) **NEW**: Validate lesson_plan.card_structure Scottish authenticity:
   * Check cards with worked_example/practice_problems use £, Scottish shops/services
   * Verify lesson_plan.multi_standard_integration_strategy mentions Scottish scenarios
   * Check card titles/purposes use CfE/SQA terminology
   * Verify card-level standards_addressed use enriched objects
8) Validate field naming
9) Check CfE/SQA-specific language
10) Check Scottish authenticity (currency, contexts, phrasing) across all cards
11) Verify lesson_instruction aligns with Scottish approaches

**Issues to Flag**:
- Incorrect unit titles or codes
- Non-standard terminology
- Bare string codes or mismatched descriptions (entry-level OR card-level)
- **NEW**: Cards use non-Scottish contexts ($ instead of £, non-Scottish shops)
- **NEW**: Cards lack Scottish scenarios in worked examples/practice problems
- **NEW**: lesson_plan.multi_standard_integration_strategy doesn't mention Scottish contexts
- Using "notes" instead of "lesson_instruction"
- Non-Scottish currency or contexts
- Non-CfE/SQA phrasing
