<dimension_2_sequencing>
## Dimension 2: Sequencing (Threshold ≥0.80)

**Purpose**: Validate logical ordering, prerequisite relationships, and realistic lesson_type cadence.

**Criteria**:
- SoW follows `recommended_sequence` from Course_data.txt
- SoW respects `sequence_rationale` from Course_data.txt
- Prerequisites (`coherence.prerequisites`) are correctly ordered
- `coherence.block_index` progresses logically and consistently
- Lesson_type cadence is realistic and varied across the SoW
- Metadata sequencing notes in `metadata.sequencing_notes` are honored
- **CHUNKING VALIDATION**: For each consolidated lesson block (2-3 standards, or up to 5 if justified):
  - Thematic coherence among chunked standards is clear and pedagogically justified
  - Lesson types follow mandatory teach→revision pairing, then formative_assessment → independent_practice
  - Every teach lesson is immediately followed (or closely followed) by its corresponding revision lesson
  - Standards within the block are sequenced logically (prerequisites first)
- **ENRICHED FORMAT**: assessmentStandardRefs are objects (code, description, outcome)
- **LESSON PLAN PRESENCE**: Every entry has lesson_plan with 6-12 detailed cards
- Alignment with `delivery_notes` (e.g., interdisciplinary opportunities, ICT use)

**Process**:
1) Validate unit sequence follows `recommended_sequence`
2) Check prerequisite logic: each entry's `prerequisites` must come earlier
3) Validate block_index: ascending, transparent ordering
4) Evaluate lesson_type cadence (varied, not repetitive) and validate teach→revision pairing:
   - For each teach lesson, verify a revision lesson exists and appears soon after
   - Check ordering: teach→revision should be consecutive or have minimal gap
5) Validate chunked sequences:
   - Identify consolidated lesson blocks
   - Confirm thematic coherence
   - Confirm ordered lesson types within each block
   - Verify prerequisites within blocks
6) Validate enriched format and guidance presence
7) Check alignment with delivery_notes

**Issues to Flag**:
- Unit sequence doesn't follow recommended_sequence
- Prerequisites reference later lessons
- Block_index is non-ascending or inconsistent
- Lesson_type cadence is repetitive or unrealistic
- Chunked standards lack thematic coherence
- Lesson types within blocks are out of order
- Missing enriched format or guidance fields
- **NEW**: Teach→revision pairing broken (teach lesson not followed by revision lesson)
- **NEW**: Revision lesson appears before its corresponding teach lesson
