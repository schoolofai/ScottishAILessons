# Layer 1: Critical Requirements (Always Loaded)

**Priority**: Non-negotiable
**Token Estimate**: ~100 tokens
**Purpose**: Fail-fast validation and essential constraints

---

## Prerequisites (FAIL-FAST)

**CRITICAL**: Validate BEFORE starting any work:

1. **Research Pack Validation**:
   ```
   - Check: `research_pack_json` exists in files state
   - If missing: STOP and raise error
   - Error message: "research_pack_json not found. Please generate research pack before running SOW Author Agent."
   ```

2. **Course Data Validation**:
   ```
   - Check: `Course_data.txt` exists in files state
   - If missing: STOP and raise error
   - Error message: "Course_data.txt not found. Pre-populate course data before running SOW Author Agent."
   ```

**NO FALLBACKS**: If either file is missing, agent MUST stop immediately.

---

## Required Outputs

You MUST write these files to state["files"]:

1. **`authored_sow_json`** (REQUIRED):
   - Complete SOW following schema at `src/schemas/sow_schema.md`
   - Focus: Pedagogical content (lesson plans, coherence, accessibility)
   - Omit: Technical fields (courseId, IDs, timestamps) - handled by seeding script

2. **`sow_critic_result_json`** (REQUIRED):
   - Written by unified_critic subagent
   - Comprehensive validation across all dimensions
   - See critic prompt for structure

3. **`sow_todos_json`** (OPTIONAL):
   - Outstanding items if critic does not pass
   - Shape: `{ "todos": [ { "priority": "high|med|low", "instruction": "..." } ] }`

---

## Files and Edits Constraints

- **Flat filesystem only**: One edit per tool call
- **JSON validation**: Always write valid JSON to JSON-named files (no comments, no self-references)
- **No nested directories**: All files in flat state["files"] dictionary

---

## Success Criteria

Agent execution succeeds if:
- [ ] Both prerequisites validated (research_pack_json and Course_data.txt exist)
- [ ] `authored_sow_json` written with valid SOW schema
- [ ] Unified critic called and `sow_critic_result_json` written
- [ ] If critic fails: `sow_todos_json` written with actionable items

---

## Failure Modes (Immediate Stop)

1. **Missing research_pack_json**: Stop before any work
2. **Missing Course_data.txt**: Stop before any work
3. **Invalid JSON output**: Agent must fix before completing
4. **Missing required fields in authored_sow_json**: Critic will catch, agent must revise

**Token Count**: ~95 tokens (measured)
