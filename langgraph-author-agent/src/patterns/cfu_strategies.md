### 2. **Structured Question**

**When to Use**: Assess procedural fluency, require showing working

**Format**: `Structured question: [Problem] [Requirement]`

**Examples**:

**Fractions**:
- "Structured question: Calculate 2/3 + 1/4 showing all working with common denominators"
- "Structured question: Simplify 18/24 to lowest terms, explaining each step"

---

### 4. **Error Identification**

**When to Use**: Address misconceptions, develop error-checking skills

**Format**: `Error identification: [Incorrect work]. [Task]`

**Examples**:

**Fractions**:
```
Error identification: "Student wrote: 1/8 > 1/4 because 8 > 4"
Find and explain the mistake, then show correct comparison
```

**Percentages**:
```
Error identification: "Student calculated 20% of £50 as £50 ÷ 20 = £2.50"
Identify the error and show correct method
```

**Decimals**:
```
Error identification: "Student wrote: 0.25 + 0.3 = 0.28"
Find the mistake and explain correct place value addition
```

---

### 5. **Think-Aloud Protocol**

---

### 6. **Self-Rating Scale**

**When to Use**: Quick confidence check, identify students needing support

**Format**: `Self-rating: [Scale] [Concept]`

**Examples**:

- "Self-rating: On a scale of 1-5, how confident are you with converting fractions to decimals?"
- "Self-rating: Rate your understanding of percentage discounts (1=confused, 5=confident)"
- "Self-rating: How comfortable are you with comparing decimals? (1-5 scale)"

---

### 7. **Quick Poll (Thumbs/Traffic Lights)**

**When to Use**: Whole-class formative check, immediate feedback

**Format**: `Quick poll: [Instruction]`

**Examples**:

- "Quick poll: Thumbs up if you can explain why 50% = 0.5, thumbs down if you need help"
- "Quick poll: Traffic lights - Green if confident with fraction simplification, Amber if unsure, Red if confused"
- "Quick poll: Show thumbs up if you've used percentages for shopping discounts before"

---

### 8. **Matching Exercise**

**When to Use**: Connect representations, test equivalence understanding

**Format**: `Matching exercise: [Match instruction]`

**Examples**:

- "Matching exercise: Match each fraction to its decimal: 1/2 = ? | 1/4 = ? | 3/4 = ?  (0.25, 0.5, 0.75)"
- "Matching exercise: Match percentages to fractions: 25% = ? | 50% = ? | 75% = ?  (1/4, 1/2, 3/4)"
- "Matching exercise: Match decimal operations to results: 0.5 × 2 = ? | 0.5 ÷ 2 = ? | 0.5 + 0.5 = ?  (0.25, 1, 1.0)"

---

### 9. **Compare and Contrast**

**When to Use**: Develop conceptual connections, assess relational understanding

**Format**: `Compare and contrast: [Comparison instruction]`

**Examples**:

- "Compare and contrast: How are fractions and percentages similar? How are they different?"
- "Compare and contrast: Explain the relationship between multiplying by 0.5 and dividing by 2"
- "Compare and contrast: What's the difference between 15% OF £60 and 15% OFF £60?"

---

### 10. **Application Question**

**When to Use**: Transfer learning to new contexts, assess practical understanding

**Format**: `Application question: [Real-life scenario]`

**Examples**:

**Shopping/Finance**:
- "Application question: Tesco offers 20% off a £45 item. Calculate your savings and final price"
- "Application question: A bus fare is £2.40. With a 15% student discount, how much do you pay?"
- "Application question: You have £50 to spend. Can you afford 3 items costing £18.99, £12.50, and £19.99?"

**Measurements**:
- "Application question: A recipe calls for 3/4 cup of flour. You're making half the recipe. How much flour do you need?"
- "Application question: A room is 3.5m long. How many 0.5m tiles fit along one wall?"

**Real-life Contexts**:
- "Application question: NHS prescription cost is £9.90. With pre-payment saving 30%, what's the discounted cost?"
- "Application question: Glasgow cinema ticket is £12. With 25% student discount, what do 2 students pay total?"

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

### ❌ **Generic CFU Strategies**:
- "Ask questions to check understanding"
- "Formative assessment"
- "Check if students get it"
- "Discussion"
- "Review material"

These provide NO actionable guidance for lesson design.

---

### ✅ **Specific CFU Strategies** (Use These):
Every CFU must include:
1. **CFU Type** (MCQ, Structured Question, etc.)
2. **Specific Prompt** (actual question or task)
3. **Optional**: Expected answer format, marking guidance

**Example**:
```
"MCQ: Which fraction equals 25%?
A) 1/2
B) 1/4
C) 1/3
D) 1/5
Expected answer: B
Marking: 1 mark for correct answer"
```

---

## Integration with Lesson Cards

When writing lesson cards, ensure CFU strategy field includes:

```json
"cfu_strategy": "MCQ: Calculate 3/4 of £20. A) £5  B) £10  C) £15  D) £20"
```

NOT:
```json
"cfu_strategy": "Ask questions about fractions"  ❌
```

---

## Scottish Context Integration

Whenever possible, embed Scottish contexts in CFU prompts:

**Good Examples**:
- "MCQ: Tesco sells milk for £1.20. With 15% discount, new price is: A) £1.02  B) £1.05  C) £1.18  D) £1.35"
- "Application question: Edinburgh Zoo adult ticket is £19.50, child ticket is £14.50. Calculate total for 2 adults + 2 children"
- "Structured question: Glasgow bus fare is £2.50. With Ridacard saving 20%, calculate weekly cost for 10 journeys"
