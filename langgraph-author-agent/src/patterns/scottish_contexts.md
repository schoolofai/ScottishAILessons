## Context Selection Guide

### By Mathematical Topic:

| Topic | Best Contexts |
|-------|---------------|
| **Fractions** | Cooking measurements, pizza sharing, discount fractions (1/3 off) |
| **Decimals** | Money calculations, measurements, sports times, utility bills |
| **Percentages** | Shop discounts, sale prices, VAT, interest, percentage changes |
| **Ratios** | Recipe scaling, mixing, comparing prices, group splits |
| **Statistics** | Sports data, class surveys, weather data, population |
| **Money** | Shopping, bills, budgeting, savings, transactions |

---

### By Engagement Level:

**High Engagement** (Use frequently):
- Supermarket shopping (daily relevance)
- Social media data (if age-appropriate)
- Gaming statistics (popular with students)
- Fast food and takeaway (relatable)
- Cinema and entertainment (aspirational)

**Medium Engagement**:
- Transport and travel
- Sports and fitness
- School-related contexts
- Technology and streaming

**Lower Engagement** (Use sparingly):

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

### ❌ **Non-Scottish Contexts**:
- Using $ or € currency
- American stores (Walmart, Target)
- Non-UK measurement units (miles per gallon)
- American spellings (math, center)

### ❌ **Generic/Abstract Contexts**:
- "A shop sells items for X"
- "Person A saves Y amount"
- "Calculate the price"

### ✅ **Scottish Authentic Contexts** (Use These):
- "Tesco sells strawberries for £3.20"
- "Callum saves £15/week from his part-time job at Greggs"
- "Calculate the Edinburgh Zoo family ticket cost"

## Integration with Lesson Cards

When designing lesson cards, select contexts that:

1. **Match the mathematical content** (fractions → pizza slices, cooking)
2. **Are age-appropriate** (secondary students → relevant to teenage life)
3. **Build engagement** (supermarket shopping, cinema, gaming)
4. **Are culturally authentic** (Scottish locations, £ currency, CfE terminology)

**Example Integration**:
```json
{
  "engagement_tags": ["shopping", "discounts", "supermarket"],
  "worked_example": "Tesco offers 25% off a £48 jacket. Calculate discount amount: £48 × 0.25 = £12. Final price: £48 - £12 = £36",
  "practice_problems": [
    "Asda reduces £60 jeans by 30%. Find sale price",
    "Sainsbury's meal deal £3.50 vs £5.20 separately. Calculate % savings"
  ]
}
```
