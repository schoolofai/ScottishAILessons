# Lesson Author Agent Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a LangGraph DeepAgent that transforms a single SoW entry into a comprehensive LessonTemplate JSON with pedagogical cards, CFUs, rubrics, and misconceptions.

**Input**: The main agent accepts TWO comma-separated JSON objects:
1. A SoW entry matching the shape in `sow_authored_AOM_nat4.txt`
2. A research pack for reference (containing exemplars, contexts, pedagogical patterns)

## Architecture (8 Subagents)

**IMPORTANT**: This implementation uses **LangGraph DeepAgent** pattern (via `async_create_deep_agent`), NOT a workflow agent. The agent orchestrates subagents through LLM-driven decision-making, following the same architecture as `sow_author_agent.py`. The workflow described in prompt `<process>` sections is what the LLM follows, not hard-coded state transitions.

### Reused Subagents (from sow_author_agent.py)
1. **research_subagent** - Answers clarification questions with Scottish context
   - Prompt: `SUB_RESEARCH_PROMPT` (from research_agent_prompts.py)
   - Tools: all_tools (Tavily + Appwrite)

2. **course_outcome_subagent** - Fetches SQA data from Appwrite
   - Prompt: `COURSE_OUTCOME_SUBAGENT_PROMPT` (from shared_prompts.py)
   - Tools: appwrite_only_tools

### New Core Subagent
3. **lesson_author_subagent** - Drafts/edits lesson template
   - Reads: `sow_entry_input.json`, `research_pack.json`, `Course_data.txt`
   - Writes: `lesson_template.json`
   - Tools: all_tools (Tavily + Appwrite)
     - Uses internet tool for:
       - Looking up URLs from research pack
       - Generic web searches for missing information
       - Clarifying Scottish contexts and examples
     - Uses Appwrite for reference templates and official SQA data
   - Logic:
     ```python
     # Parse SoW entry metadata
     lesson_type = entry["lesson_type"]  # teach, practice, assessment, etc.
     pedagogical_blocks = entry.get("pedagogical_blocks", [])

     # Map lesson_type to card structure
     if lesson_type == "teach":
         cards = [
             starter_card,  # retrieval/hook
             modelling_card,  # worked example
             guided_practice_card,  # scaffolded CFU
             independent_practice_card  # full CFU
         ]
     elif lesson_type == "formative_assessment":
         cards = [assessment_card_1, assessment_card_2, ...]

     # Populate cards with CFUs, rubrics, misconceptions
     for card in cards:
         card["cfu"] = generate_cfu(assessment_standards, engagement_tags)
         card["rubric"] = generate_rubric(cfu_type)
         card["misconceptions"] = identify_misconceptions(topic)

     # Write to lesson_template.json
     ```

### New Critic Subagents
4. **pedagogical_design_critic** - Evaluates lesson flow
   - Validates I-We-You progression
   - Checks scaffolding appropriateness
   - Ensures lesson_type alignment with card types
   - Writes: `pedagogical_critic_result.json`
   - Tools: all_tools
   - Threshold: ≥0.85

5. **assessment_design_critic** - Reviews CFU quality
   - Evaluates CFU variety (numeric, MCQ, short, structured)
   - Validates rubric criteria clarity
   - Checks misconception identification
   - Ensures assessment standards coverage
   - Writes: `assessment_critic_result.json`
   - Tools: all_tools
   - Threshold: ≥0.90

6. **accessibility_critic** - Checks inclusive design
   - Reviews plain language (CEFR level)
   - Validates dyslexia-friendly features
   - Checks extra_time provisions
   - Ensures explainer_plain fields present
   - Writes: `accessibility_critic_result.json`
   - Tools: internet_only_tools
   - Threshold: ≥0.90

7. **scottish_context_critic** - Validates Scottish authenticity
   - Verifies £ currency
   - Checks engagement_tags relevance
   - Validates local context examples (ScotRail, NHS, etc.)
   - Ensures SQA/CfE terminology
   - Writes: `scottish_context_critic_result.json`
   - Tools: all_tools
   - Threshold: ≥0.90

8. **coherence_critic** - Ensures SoW alignment
   - Validates outcome/assessment standard mapping
   - Checks lesson_type consistency
   - Verifies timing estimates (estMinutes)
   - Ensures prerequisite handling
   - Writes: `coherence_critic_result.json`
   - Tools: appwrite_only_tools
   - Threshold: ≥0.85

## Orchestration Flow

The DeepAgent orchestration logic is defined in the prompt `<process>` sections (see LESSON_AGENT_PROMPT below). The LLM follows these instructions to:
1. Parse dual JSON inputs and write to files
2. Call course_outcome_subagent to fetch SQA data
3. Call lesson_author_subagent to draft the lesson template
4. Run 5 critics in parallel (up to 3 iterations)
5. Revise based on feedback or finalize with todos

This is **LLM-driven orchestration**, not hard-coded workflow transitions.

## File Structure

### Input Files
- `sow_entry_input.json` - Single SoW entry from authored_sow
- `research_pack.json` - Research pack containing exemplars, contexts, pedagogical patterns, and reference URLs
- `Course_data.txt` - SQA official data (fetched by course_outcome_subagent)

### Output Files
- `lesson_template.json` - Final lesson template
- `pedagogical_critic_result.json` - Pedagogical flow evaluation
- `assessment_critic_result.json` - CFU/rubric quality check
- `accessibility_critic_result.json` - Inclusive design validation
- `scottish_context_critic_result.json` - Scottish authenticity verification
- `coherence_critic_result.json` - SoW alignment check
- `lesson_todos.json` - Outstanding items if critics don't pass

## Prompts to Create (lesson_author_prompts.py)

The following sections provide complete prompt templates for all agents and subagents. Each prompt follows best practices: clear role definition, explicit inputs/outputs, validation criteria, step-by-step process, and constraints.

### 1. LESSON_AGENT_PROMPT (Main Orchestrator)

```python
LESSON_AGENT_PROMPT = """<role>

</subagents_available>

<process>
1) **Write Input to Files**: Parse the TWO JSON objects from user input and write to `sow_entry_input.json` and `research_pack.json`.
2) **Read** both files to understand the SoW entry metadata and research pack content.
3) **Call** `course_outcome_subagent` to:
   - Fetch official SQA course data from Appwrite database
   - Write authoritative course specifications to `Course_data.txt`
4) If needed, **ask** `research_subagent` for clarifications (pedagogical patterns, URL lookups, Scottish contexts).
5) **Draft** the LessonTemplate by calling `lesson_author_subagent` — it must:
   - Read `sow_entry_input.json`, `research_pack.json`, and `Course_data.txt`
   - Write a valid JSON object to `lesson_template.json` following the LessonTemplate schema
   - Create 3-5 pedagogical cards with varied CFU types
   - Include rubrics with point allocations and criteria
   - Identify 1-3 common misconceptions per card
6) **Critique loop** (up to 3 iterations, run critics in parallel):
   a) `pedagogical_design_critic`    → `pedagogical_critic_result.json` (threshold ≥0.85)
   b) `assessment_design_critic`     → `assessment_critic_result.json` (threshold ≥0.90)
   c) `accessibility_critic`         → `accessibility_critic_result.json` (threshold ≥0.90)
   d) `scottish_context_critic`      → `scottish_context_critic_result.json` (threshold ≥0.90)
   e) `coherence_critic`             → `coherence_critic_result.json` (threshold ≥0.85)

   If any critic fails, **revise** `lesson_template.json` via `lesson_author_subagent` and re-run only the failed critics.
7) If some critics still fail after 3 iterations, write **`lesson_todos.json`** with specific actionable items and keep `lesson_template.json` as the best current draft.
</process>

<success_criteria>
- `lesson_template.json` is valid JSON matching the LessonTemplate schema
- Creates 3-5 pedagogical cards with varied CFU types (numeric, MCQ, short, structured)
- Includes rubrics with clear criteria and point allocations
- Identifies 1-3 common misconceptions per card with clarifications

- Critic results (if available): JSON feedback files from critic subagents.
</inputs>

<outputs>
- `lesson_template.json`: Complete LessonTemplate JSON following the schema below.
- Format must be valid JSON, self-contained, no partial fragments.
</outputs>

<tools_available>
- **all_tools** (Tavily internet search + Appwrite MCP):
  - Use internet tool for:
    * Looking up URLs from research pack (e.g., exemplar sources)
    * Generic web searches for missing information (Scottish contexts, current prices, local services)
    * Clarifying pedagogical patterns or misconceptions
  - Use Appwrite for:
    * Fetching reference LessonTemplates for similar lesson_types
    * Validating outcome and assessment standard codes
</tools_available>

<workflow>
1. **Read inputs**: `sow_entry_input.json`, `research_pack.json`, `Course_data.txt`
2. **Determine card structure** based on lesson_type:
   - `teach`: starter (retrieval/hook) → modelling (worked example) → guided_practice (scaffolded CFU) → independent_practice (full CFU)
   - `independent_practice`: 3-4 practice cards with progressive difficulty
   - `formative_assessment`: 2-3 assessment cards covering different CFU types
   - `revision`: starter quiz → practice problems → challenge problems
   - Adapt based on estMinutes (fewer cards for shorter lessons)
3. **Use pedagogical_blocks** from SoW entry as card structure hints if provided
4. **Populate each card**:
   - `title`: Clear, student-facing title reflecting the card's purpose
   - `explainer`: Detailed explanation with worked examples (for teach/modelling cards)
   - `explainer_plain`: Short sentences, CEFR level appropriate, one instruction per line
   - `cfu`: Generate Check for Understanding aligned with assessment standards

     * Use assessment_stems from research pack where applicable
     * Ensure currency in £, Scottish contexts from engagement_tags
   - `rubric`: Clear criteria with point allocations
     * total_points should reflect assessment standard complexity
     * criteria should cover method, accuracy, units, and working
   - `misconceptions`: Identify 1-3 common student errors from research pack
     * Include clarification strategies
5. **If information is missing**, use internet tool to:
   - Look up URLs from research pack for current examples
   - Search for Scottish-specific contexts (e.g., "ScotRail fares", "NHS Scotland services")
   - Find authentic engagement examples matching engagement_tags
6. **Apply policy** from SoW entry:
   - Set `policy.calculator_allowed` based on `calculator_section`
   - Add assessment_notes to relevant cards
7. **Apply accessibility** from SoW entry:
   - Use `plain_language_level` to guide explainer_plain complexity
   - Add dyslexia-friendly features if flagged
   - Ensure extra_time provisions are reflected in card design
8. If critic feedback is present, integrate and revise the draft
9. Write complete JSON to `lesson_template.json`

<card_design_patterns>
## Lesson Type → Card Structure Mapping

**teach**:
- Card 1 (Starter): Retrieval practice or hook question
- Card 2 (Modelling): Worked example with detailed explainer
- Card 3 (Guided Practice): Scaffolded CFU with hints
- Card 4 (Independent Practice): Full CFU requiring method and answer

**independent_practice**:
- Card 1: Basic practice (lower difficulty)
- Card 2: Standard practice (medium difficulty)
- Card 3: Challenge practice (higher difficulty)
- Optional Card 4: Extension or real-world application

**formative_assessment**:
- Card 1: Assessment Standard 1 CFU
- Card 2: Assessment Standard 2 CFU
- Card 3: Integration/application CFU

**revision**:
- Card 1: Starter quiz (quick checks)
- Card 2: Practice problems (mixed difficulty)
- Card 3: Challenge problems (exam-style)

Adapt card count based on estMinutes:
- 25-35 mins: 2-3 cards
- 40-50 mins: 3-4 cards
- 50+ mins: 4-5 cards
</card_design_patterns>

<cfu_variety_guide>
## CFU Type Distribution by Lesson Type

**teach**: Primarily numeric and short, introduce one MCQ for checking
**independent_practice**: Mix of numeric (60%), short (30%), structured (10%)
**formative_assessment**: All types represented - numeric, MCQ, short, structured
**revision**: MCQ (40%), numeric (40%), short (20%)

**CFU Type Details**:
- `numeric`: Expected value with tolerance, money2dp flag for currency
- `mcq`: Options array with answerIndex
- `short`: Text expected response
- `structured`: Multi-part question with sub-criteria in rubric

Always align CFU difficulty with assessment standard requirements from Course_data.txt.
</cfu_variety_guide>

<misconception_identification>
## Common Misconceptions by Topic

Extract from research_pack.json → distilled_data.pedagogical_patterns.misconceptions.

For each card, identify 1-3 misconceptions relevant to the CFU:
- Procedural errors (e.g., wrong operation order)
- Conceptual misunderstandings (e.g., percent vs decimal confusion)
- Common calculation mistakes (e.g., rounding too early)

Each misconception must include:
- `id`: Unique identifier (e.g., "MISC_PERCENT_DIV100")
- `misconception`: Student's incorrect thinking pattern
- `clarification`: Remediation strategy or correct approach

Use exemplars from research pack where available; otherwise, use internet search for common errors in the topic area.
</misconception_identification>

<constraints>
- Write valid JSON only (no comments)
- Do not omit required fields
- Ensure all outcomeRefs and assessmentStandardRefs match Course_data.txt codes
- Keep explainer_plain at CEFR level specified in SoW entry accessibility_profile
- Use £ for all currency (never $ or €)
- Ensure engagement_tags are reflected in context_hooks and CFU stems
- If using internet search, cite sources in context_hooks or notes

```python
SCOTTISH_CONTEXT_CRITIC_PROMPT = """<role>
You are the Scottish Context Critic. Your job is to verify that the `lesson_template.json` feels authentic to Scottish classrooms, uses official SQA terminology, and reflects realistic local contexts.
</role>

<inputs>
- `lesson_template.json`: The lesson template to critique.
- `Course_data.txt`: Official SQA terminology and course structure.
- `research_pack.json`: Scottish contexts and exemplars.
- `sow_entry_input.json`: Engagement tags from SoW entry.
</inputs>

<outputs>
Write your critique to `scottish_context_critic_result.json` with this shape:
{
  "pass": true | false,
  "score": 0.0-1.0,
  "feedback": "...",
  "issues": ["...", "..."]
}
</outputs>

<criteria>
- **Currency**:
  * All monetary values in £ (not $, €, or unspecified)
  * Realistic Scottish prices (e.g., bus fares £2-£5, supermarket items)
- **Engagement Tags Relevance**:
  * Do CFU contexts reflect engagement_tags from SoW entry?
  * Are contexts authentic to Scottish settings (not generic)?
  * Examples: ScotRail, NHS Scotland, local supermarkets (Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's), Scottish postcodes
- **Local Context Examples**:
  * Use Scottish place names where applicable (Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Highlands)
  * Reference Scottish services (NHS, local councils, Scottish Parliament)
  * Avoid US/English-only contexts (zip codes, dollars, state names)
- **SQA/CfE Terminology**:
  * Use exact outcome titles from Course_data.txt
  * Use correct assessment standard codes
  * Follow SQA phrasing conventions (e.g., "working shown", "method marks")
- **Threshold**: ≥0.90 to pass.
</criteria>

<process>
1) Read all input files
2) Extract engagement_tags from SoW entry
3) Check template-level fields:
   - Verify outcomeRefs and assessmentStandardRefs match Course_data.txt codes
   - Check engagement_tags are present and authentic
4) For each card CFU:
   - Check currency (all £)
   - Verify contexts match engagement_tags
   - Evaluate Scottish authenticity (local services, realistic examples)
5) Check terminology:
   - Compare outcome/standard titles against Course_data.txt
   - Verify SQA-specific language in rubrics and notes
6) Check context_hooks:
   - Are they specific to Scotland?
   - Do they reference real Scottish services/locations?
7) Assign score (0.0-1.0) based on:
   - Currency correctness: 0.2
   - Engagement tag alignment: 0.3
   - Local context authenticity: 0.3
   - SQA terminology accuracy: 0.2
8) Write detailed feedback with examples of good/poor authenticity
9) Write result to `scottish_context_critic_result.json`
</process>

<scottish_context_examples>
**GOOD**:
- "A single bus fare in Edinburgh costs £1.80. A day ticket costs £4.50..."
- "NHS Scotland prescription charges are £9.65..."
- "Tesco sells a loaf of bread for £1.05..."
- Context_hooks: ["Use ScotRail timetable", "Reference Glasgow postcode G2"]

**BAD**:
- "A bus ticket costs $2.50..." (currency)
- "The prescription costs 15 dollars..." (currency + non-Scottish)
- "Use the subway in New York..." (wrong country)
- Context_hooks: ["Use generic shopping examples"] (not Scottish-specific)
</scottish_context_examples>

<sqa_terminology_validation>
Check against `Course_data.txt`:
- Unit titles must match exactly (e.g., "Applications of Mathematics: Manage Money and Data (National 3)")
- Outcome IDs correct format (e.g., "O1", "O2")
- Assessment standard codes correct format (e.g., "AS1.2", "AS2.1")
- Use official language from assessment model (e.g., "AVU", "SCQF credits", "internal assessment")

<criteria>
- **Outcome/Assessment Standard Mapping**:
  * Does lesson_template.outcomeRefs match sow_entry.outcomeRefs?
  * Does lesson_template.assessmentStandardRefs match sow_entry.assessmentStandardRefs?
  * Are all standards actually addressed by CFUs in the cards?
- **Lesson Type Consistency**:
  * Does lesson_template.lesson_type match sow_entry.lesson_type?
  * Do card structures align with lesson_type expectations?
- **Timing Estimates**:
  * Does lesson_template.estMinutes match sow_entry.estMinutes?
  * Is card count realistic for the time allocation?
- **Engagement Tags**:
  * Does lesson_template.engagement_tags match sow_entry.engagement_tags?
  * Are these tags reflected in CFU contexts?
- **Policy Alignment**:
  * Does policy.calculator_allowed align with sow_entry.policy.calculator_section?
  * Non-calc → false, calc → true, mixed → varies by card
- **Title Alignment**:
  * Does lesson_template.title match sow_entry.label?
- **Course ID**:
  * Is courseId consistent between template and SoW?
- **Threshold**: ≥0.85 to pass.
</criteria>

<process>
1) Read `lesson_template.json`, `sow_entry_input.json`, `Course_data.txt`
2) Compare field-by-field:
   - title vs label
   - lesson_type (exact match required)
   - estMinutes (should match or be within ±5 minutes)
   - outcomeRefs (arrays should match exactly)
   - assessmentStandardRefs (arrays should match exactly)
   - engagement_tags (should match)
3) Verify calculator policy alignment:
   - Extract calculator_section from SoW entry
   - Check lesson template policy.calculator_allowed
   - Validate mapping (non_calc → false, calc → true, mixed → context-dependent)
4) Check assessment standard coverage in cards:
   - For each standard in assessmentStandardRefs, verify at least one CFU addresses it
   - Check CFU difficulty matches standard requirements from Course_data.txt
5) Validate card count vs estMinutes:
   - 25-35 mins: 2-3 cards expected
   - 40-50 mins: 3-4 cards expected
   - 50+ mins: 4-5 cards expected
6) Assign score (0.0-1.0) based on:
   - Outcome/standard mapping: 0.3
   - Lesson type consistency: 0.2
   - Timing alignment: 0.15
   - Engagement tags: 0.15
   - Policy alignment: 0.1
   - Title/courseId: 0.1
7) Write detailed feedback noting any misalignments
8) Write result to `coherence_critic_result.json`
</process>

<calculator_policy_mapping>
SoW entry `policy.calculator_section` → Lesson template `policy.calculator_allowed`:
- "non_calc" → false
- "calc" → true
- "mixed" → context-dependent (can vary by card, but template-level should reflect primary mode)

If mismatch detected, flag as issue with specific recommendation.

# Create the Lesson Author DeepAgent
agent = async_create_deep_agent(
    model=gemini,
    tools=all_tools,
    instructions=LESSON_AGENT_PROMPT,
    subagents=subagents,
    context_schema=LessonAuthorState,
).with_config({"recursion_limit": 1000})
```

**Key Points**:
- Uses `async_create_deep_agent` (for MCP tool integration)
- LLM orchestrates subagent calls based on `LESSON_AGENT_PROMPT` instructions
- NOT a state machine with hard-coded transitions
- Flat file storage via `state["files"]` dictionary
- Custom state schema with todos reducer prevents InvalidUpdateError

### lesson_author_prompts.py
```python
# All 7 prompt templates
- LESSON_AGENT_PROMPT (main orchestrator)
- LESSON_AUTHOR_SUBAGENT_PROMPT (core author)
- PEDAGOGICAL_DESIGN_CRITIC_PROMPT
- ASSESSMENT_DESIGN_CRITIC_PROMPT
- ACCESSIBILITY_CRITIC_PROMPT
- SCOTTISH_CONTEXT_CRITIC_PROMPT
- COHERENCE_CRITIC_PROMPT
```

### lesson_author_state.py (new)
```python
# Custom state schema with todos reducer
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
from operator import add

class LessonAuthorState(TypedDict):
    messages: list  # LangGraph messages
    todos: Annotated[list, add]  # Reducer prevents InvalidUpdateError
    files: dict  # Flat file storage
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **DeepAgent Pattern** - Uses `async_create_deep_agent` with LLM-driven orchestration (NOT workflow agent with hard-coded state transitions)
2. **Reuse existing infrastructure** - Same tools, similar architecture as sow_author_agent.py
3. **Card-centric design** - Each card has explainer, CFU, rubric, misconceptions
4. **Multi-critic validation** - 5 specialized critics ensure quality
5. **Iterative refinement** - Up to 3 revision loops controlled by LLM based on critic feedback
6. **Scottish grounding** - Course_data.txt provides official SQA structure
7. **Parallel critique** - Critics run simultaneously for efficiency (LLM decides when)
8. **Threshold-based passing** - Each critic has explicit quality bar (≥0.85 or ≥0.90)

## Testing Strategy

```bash
# From langgraph-author-agent directory
langgraph dev --port 2025

# Test with SoW entry + research pack (dual JSON input)
curl -X POST http://localhost:2025/invoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": {
      "sow_entry": {
        "order": 86,
        "lessonTemplateRef": "AUTO_TBD_86",
        "label": "Revision: Best Deals",
        "lesson_type": "revision",
        ...
      },
      "research_pack": {
        "exemplars": [...],
        "contexts": [...],
        "urls": [...]
      }
    }
  }'
```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Generates valid LessonTemplate JSON matching MVP2.5 schema
- ✅ Creates 3-5 pedagogical cards with varied CFU types
- ✅ Includes rubrics with point allocations and criteria
- ✅ Identifies 1-3 common misconceptions per card
- ✅ Passes all 5 critic thresholds
- ✅ Aligns with SoW entry metadata (outcomes, assessment standards)
- ✅ Uses authentic Scottish contexts (£, local services)
- ✅ Maintains accessibility (plain language, dyslexia-friendly)
