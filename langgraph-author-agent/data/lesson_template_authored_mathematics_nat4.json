We don't write £1.65p.\\n2.  **Pence:** For items under a pound, like the crisps, we write £0.95. You can also write this as 95p. Both are correct, but you never mix them.\\n3.  **Weight:** We use 'g' for grams (for lighter things like bread) and 'kg' for kilograms (for heavier things like apples). Remember, 1 kg = 1000 g.\\n4.  **Volume:** We use 'ml' for millilitres and 'l' for litres to measure liquids. 1 l = 1000 ml.",
