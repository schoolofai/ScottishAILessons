        "guidance": "The assessment for National 3 Applications of Mathematics is internally assessed on a pass/fail basis for each unit's outcomes. The primary goal of marking is to confirm that learners have demonstrated the required skills, knowledge, and understanding as outlined in the assessment standards. Assessors should adopt a positive marking approach, awarding credit for demonstrated competence rather than deducting for errors. Professional judgment is key, especially in cases of minor errors or incomplete solutions that still show correct methodology.\n\nGeneral Marking Principles:\n\nIssue: How to award marks when a candidate makes an error.\nExamples: A calculation error in an early step, but subsequent steps correctly apply the incorrect value.\nInstructions: Assessors must follow through working subsequent to an error and award possible consequential marks, provided that the level of difficulty involved is approximately similar to the intended task. Do not deduct marks for errors or omissions; instead, award marks for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge, and understanding.\n\nIssue: When to award full marks for an answer.\nExamples: A correct final answer is given without any supporting calculations or steps.\nInstructions: Only award full marks where the solution contains appropriate working. A correct answer with no working receives no mark, unless specifically mentioned in the marking instructions for a particular assessment.\n\nIssue: Handling minor inaccuracies or rounding errors.\nExamples: A candidate rounds an intermediate answer incorrectly, or truncates a decimal prematurely.\nInstructions: Assessors can ignore minor errors, such as incorrectly rounded or truncated answers, if these errors do not prevent the candidate from demonstrating the mathematical skill being assessed. If a candidate is penalised for incorrect rounding in one part of an assessment, they should not be penalised for incorrect rounding again in the same assessment, unless the question explicitly requests specific rounding.\n\nIssue: Omission of units in answers.\nExamples: A candidate provides a numerical answer (e.g., \"15\") but omits the unit (e.g., \"cm\" or \"£\").\nInstructions: Candidates should not miss out on marks for omitting units unless this is specifically mentioned in the marking instructions for that particular assessment. If units are omitted on multiple occasions within an assessment, the candidate should only be penalised for this once.\n\nIssue: Candidate uses an alternative, but mathematically correct, method.\nExamples: A candidate solves a problem using a different formula or approach than what was anticipated, but the method is valid.\nInstructions: Candidates may use any mathematically correct method to answer questions, except in cases where a particular method is specified or explicitly excluded by the assessment instructions.\n\nIssue: Transcription errors (copying numbers/symbols incorrectly).\nExamples: A candidate copies a number from the question paper to their script incorrectly, or makes a minor error when rewriting an expression within their working.\nInstructions: If a candidate makes a transcription error, they lose the opportunity to gain the next process mark associated with that step. However, if the error is trivial and the candidate proceeds to deal with the intended problem correctly, benefit of the doubt may be given.\n\nIssue: Simplifying numerical values in final answers.\nExamples: A final answer is left as an unsimplified fraction (e.g., 15/12) or an uncalculated square root of a perfect square (e.g., √64).\nInstructions: In final answers, candidates should simplify numerical values as far as possible, unless the detailed marking instructions specifically state otherwise. For example, 15/12 should be simplified to 5/4 or 1 1/4, and √64 should be simplified to 8.\n\nIssue: Assessment thresholds for outcomes.\nExamples: A candidate achieves 55% for Outcome 1 and 65% for Outcome 2 in a unit.\nInstructions: For Applications of Mathematics and Numeracy units, a threshold of 60% is applied for Outcome 1 and 60% for Outcome 2. Each outcome requires a separate judgement. If a candidate does not reach the threshold for an outcome or a unit, they could still achieve the outcome or unit if they pass the assessment standards individually. Centres should use the approach that benefits their candidates most.\n\nIssue: Clarity of assessment judgements during internal verification.\nExamples: Assessor and internal verifier disagree on a mark, and the final decision is not clearly recorded.\nInstructions: Where assessment judgements differ, it is helpful to clearly mark the final decision on the candidate's script and record of achievement table. Assessors should ensure accurate recording of marks on achievement tables to prevent candidates from not being awarded units they have achieved."
