For example, a banana costs **9p**.\n- If it's a pound or more, we use the '£' sign and a decimal point. A loaf of bread is **£1.45**. Always use two numbers after the decimal point for money. So, we write £1.50, not £1.5.\n\n**Measurements:**\nWe use different units for different things.\n- For weight, we use grams (g) and kilograms (kg). A small bag of crisps is **30g**, but a large bag of flour is **1.5kg**.\n- For volume (liquids), we use millilitres (ml) and litres (l). A can of juice is **330ml**, but a large bottle of milk is **2l**.\n\nLook at my example: I bought a bottle of milk. The label says '2 litres'. I write this as **2l**.
