Assessment judgements must be valid, reliable, and consistent with national standards. Assessors should focus on whether candidates have met the specified assessment standards for each outcome within the Units, rather than applying additional, unrequired criteria.\n\nIssues → Examples → Instructions to Markers:\n\nIssue: Incomplete Unit Submissions\nExamples: A candidate for the Producing Language Unit has submitted only writing evidence, but not talking evidence. Another candidate has submitted evidence for some, but not all, outcomes within a unit.\nInstructions: When completing verification sample forms, centres must enter a pass or fail based on the candidate's *current submitted evidence*. Do not automatically mark as a 'fail' if an outcome is not yet completed; this constitutes 'interim evidence'. If all outcomes for a unit are included, it is complete evidence.\n\nIssue: Insufficient Opportunity to Meet Assessment Standards (Reading & Listening)\nExamples: Centre-devised assessments for Understanding Language or Literacy Units ask candidates to simply retrieve information for AS 1.1/2.1. Assessments do not provide opportunities for candidates to select and comment on at least two features of language for AS 1.2/2.2.\nInstructions: For AS 1.1 and 2.1, questions must require candidates to demonstrate understanding in their *own words*, not just retrieve information. For AS 1.2 and 2.2, centre-devised materials *must* offer candidates the opportunity to select and comment on at least two examples of language. Ensure the demand of the assessment is appropriate for SCQF level 3.\n\nIssue: Use of Obsolete Assessment Standards\nExamples: Centre-devised materials or outdated unit assessment support packs still require candidates to comment on 'audience and purpose' for reading/listening, or include AS 1.3 for writing.\nInstructions: Following revisions in 2017, 'audience and purpose' is no longer a requirement for assessment standards 1.1 and 2.1 in Understanding Language. Assessment Standard 1.3 for writing was removed in 2017-18. Centres *must* use the most up-to-date SQA assessment materials and unit assessment support packs and *not* assess these removed standards.\n\nIssue: Lack of Detail in Talking Assessment Evidence\nExamples: Checklists for spoken activities are too broad, lacking specific examples of language used by the candidate. Submissions do not provide sufficient evidence of how assessment standards for talking have been met.\nInstructions: For talking assessments (e.g., Producing Language Outcome 2), detailed checklists *must* include specific examples of words and phrases used by the candidate within their presentation or discussion. This provides clear evidence of how assessment standards are met and supports verification.\n\nIssue: Overly Severe Marking for Writing\nExamples: Centres have amended their internal judging evidence tables to include additional criteria not required by SQA, leading to candidates being judged too harshly.\nInstructions: Adhere strictly to SQA's published assessment criteria. Do *not* introduce additional criteria that are not part of the official unit specification or assessment standards. Judgements should be based solely on the required evidence for a pass at National 3.\n\nIssue: Support Exceeding 'Reasonable Assistance'\nExamples: Teachers provide candidates with significant scaffolding, sentence starts, or model paragraphs for assessment tasks.\nInstructions: Teachers and lecturers *can* clarify how to approach the assessment and guide candidates in producing their response. They *may* prompt candidates to clarify requirements. However, they *must not* direct candidates as to any specific response, provide specific advice on how to improve responses, or offer model answers. Significant scaffolding, sentence starts, or model paragraphs are *not* considered reasonable assistance at this level.\n\nIssue: Ineffective Internal Verification\nExamples: Centres do not provide an overview of their internal verification procedures, or documentation lacks clear annotation of candidate scripts.\nInstructions: Centres *must* review their internal verification processes to ensure effectiveness. Good practice includes using SQA's Internal Verification Toolkit. Submissions for verification should include clear annotation on candidate scripts by individual assessors and detailed assessment commentaries. A record of professional dialogue between assessors and verifiers is highly recommended to illustrate discussions and support verification."
