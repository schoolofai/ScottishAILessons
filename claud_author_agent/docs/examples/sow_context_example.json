  "coherence": "This National 5 Mathematics course progresses from numerical foundations through algebraic reasoning to applied problem-solving. Early lessons (1-4) build fraction, decimal, and percentage fluency. Mid-course lessons (5-8) introduce algebraic expressions and equations. Later lessons (9-12) focus on geometric reasoning and data analysis. Scottish contexts and real-world applications are emphasized throughout.",
  "accessibility_notes": "All lessons include CEFR A2-B1 plain language explainers for dyslexic students and English learners. Visual aids are described textually for screen reader compatibility. Scaffolding reduced progressively across course to build independence.",
  "engagement_notes": "Scottish contexts emphasized throughout (ScotRail, NHS Scotland, Tesco, Edinburgh Festival). Real-world applications connect to student interests (shopping, budgeting, travel planning). Authentic Scottish data sources used where possible (e.g., actual train fares, realistic supermarket pricing).",
