# Feature Specification: Claude Diagram Generation Agent

**Feature Branch**: `001-claude-diagram-agent`
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create the functionality in the langgraph deep agent @langgraph-author-agent/src/diagram_author_agent.py the documentation for this is in @langgraph-author-agent/docs/DIAGRAM_AUTHOR_README.md in a claude agent instead - there are several claude agents aready implemented in @claud_author_agent/ i want to use the same patterns and in these. the new claude diagram agent will also have a cli wrapper like the other cluade agents - this will allow cli based operations 1. single lesson template daigram generation - this mode will take courseId and sow order and generate diagrams for the lesson - and populate the entry in collection lesson_diagram in appwrite 2. batch mode - where it takes courseId and generates diagrams for all available lessons for that courseID - in batch mode there should be a dry run option like with the @claud_author_agent/src/lesson_author_cli.py - if there is lesson_diagram entry for the lesson already it should skip generation unless --force option is provided"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Single Lesson Diagram Generation (Priority: P1)

A curriculum developer needs to generate JSXGraph visualizations for mathematical concepts in a newly authored lesson template. They provide the course identifier and lesson order number, and the system generates pedagogically appropriate diagrams that are automatically stored in the database.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - generating high-quality mathematical diagrams for individual lessons. Without this, the feature delivers no value. It's the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a courseId and order number for an existing lesson template that contains mathematical content. Success means diagrams are generated, meet quality thresholds, and are persisted to the Appwrite lesson_diagrams collection. No batch infrastructure needed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid courseId and order for a lesson template with 3 cards containing mathematical content, **When** the user runs the diagram generation command, **Then** the system generates JSXGraph diagrams for all 3 cards, validates them against quality criteria (â‰¥0.85 threshold), and persists them to Appwrite with execution metrics reported
2. **Given** a valid courseId and order for a lesson template with no visual content needed, **When** the user runs the diagram generation command, **Then** the system analyzes all cards, determines no diagrams are needed, and reports successful completion with 0 diagrams generated
3. **Given** an invalid courseId format (not matching "course_*" pattern), **When** the user provides this input, **Then** the system throws a validation exception with a clear error message before any API calls are made
4. **Given** a courseId and order where the lesson template does not exist in Appwrite, **When** the user runs the diagram generation command, **Then** the system throws an exception indicating the lesson template cannot be found with actionable next steps

---

### User Story 2 - Batch Processing with Dry-Run Preview (Priority: P2)

A curriculum coordinator needs to generate diagrams for all lessons in a course efficiently. Before committing to the full generation process (which incurs API costs), they want to preview what would be generated and see estimated costs.

**Why this priority**: Batch processing enables scalability for courses with many lessons (10-50 lessons common). Dry-run prevents costly mistakes and provides transparency. This extends P1 functionality to production-scale use cases without replacing the core single-lesson workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing a courseId with multiple lesson templates. Dry-run mode should analyze all lessons, identify cards needing diagrams, calculate cost estimates, and output a JSON report without making any generation API calls. Success means accurate preview without side effects.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a courseId with 15 lesson templates where 10 contain mathematical content, **When** the user runs batch mode with --dry-run flag, **Then** the system analyzes all 15 lessons, identifies 10 requiring diagrams, calculates estimated token costs and total USD cost, and outputs a JSON report without generating any diagrams
2. **Given** a courseId with 8 lesson templates where 5 already have diagrams in the database, **When** the user runs batch mode with --dry-run (no --force), **Then** the system reports that 3 new lessons need diagrams and 5 will be skipped, with cost estimates reflecting only the 3 new generations
3. **Given** a courseId with 20 lesson templates, **When** the user runs batch mode without --dry-run, **Then** the system processes all lessons sequentially, generates diagrams for those needing them, skips those with existing diagrams, and reports final metrics including successes and any failures
4. **Given** a batch operation where 2 out of 10 lessons fail diagram generation, **When** the batch completes, **Then** the system reports partial success with 8 diagrams persisted and 2 errors logged with detailed diagnostic information

---

### User Story 3 - Force Regeneration for Quality Improvements (Priority: P3)

A curriculum developer notices that previously generated diagrams don't meet updated quality standards or contain errors. They need to regenerate specific diagrams without manually deleting existing entries.

**Why this priority**: Quality iteration is essential for educational content. As prompt engineering improves or visual standards evolve, educators need to update existing diagrams. This is optional enhancement - P1 and P2 handle net-new generation. Force mode enables continuous improvement workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating a diagram for a lesson (creating an entry in lesson_diagrams), then running the command again with --force flag. Success means the existing diagram is replaced with a newly generated one, and the database reflects updated timestamps and metrics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a lesson that already has diagrams in the database, **When** the user runs single-lesson mode with --force flag, **Then** the system regenerates all diagrams for that lesson and overwrites existing database entries with new content and updated timestamps
2. **Given** a courseId with 10 lessons all having existing diagrams, **When** the user runs batch mode with --force, **Then** the system regenerates diagrams for all 10 lessons regardless of existing entries and updates the database
3. **Given** a lesson with existing diagrams, **When** the user runs single-lesson mode without --force, **Then** the system detects existing diagrams, skips generation, and reports that diagrams already exist with instructions to use --force if regeneration is desired

---

### User Story 4 - Multi-Method Input for Different Workflows (Priority: P4)

Different users have different operational preferences. Curriculum developers may prefer interactive prompts during exploratory work, automation scripts need JSON file inputs for reproducibility, and CI/CD pipelines require command-line arguments.

**Why this priority**: Developer experience enhancement. P1 could work with just one input method, but supporting all three removes friction and enables integration across workflows (manual exploration, scripting, automation). This mirrors established patterns in existing Claude agents.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by invoking the CLI in three ways: (1) providing JSON file path, (2) passing CLI arguments, (3) running with no arguments to trigger interactive mode. All three should result in identical diagram generation behavior given the same courseId and order inputs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a JSON file containing {"courseId": "course_123", "order": 2}, **When** the user runs the CLI with --input flag pointing to this file, **Then** the system loads parameters from the JSON and generates diagrams for the specified lesson
2. **Given** command-line arguments --courseId course_123 --order 2, **When** the user runs the CLI, **Then** the system uses these arguments directly and generates diagrams
3. **Given** no input method provided (no JSON file, no CLI args), **When** the user runs the CLI, **Then** the system enters interactive mode, prompts for courseId and order, and generates diagrams based on user responses
4. **Given** partial command-line arguments (only --courseId without --order), **When** the user runs the CLI, **Then** the system throws an error indicating both parameters are required when using CLI arguments

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the DiagramScreenshot service (localhost:3001) is not running or unreachable?
- How does the system handle lesson templates with 50+ cards (large documents)?
- What happens when a card's mathematical content is ambiguous or unsuitable for visualization?
- How does the system handle network timeouts during Appwrite queries or diagram rendering?
- What happens when a diagram generation attempt produces invalid JSXGraph JSON syntax?
- How does the system handle lessons with mixed content (some cards need diagrams, others don't)?
- What happens when the visual critic subagent fails to score a diagram (malformed image data)?
- How does the system handle batch mode when Appwrite rate limits are reached mid-process?
- What happens when cost tracking fails (metrics collection error)?
- How does the system handle workspace cleanup failures (disk full, permission errors)?

## Assumptions *(documented defaults)*

1. **DiagramScreenshot Service Availability**: Service runs at http://localhost:3001 with /health and /render endpoints available. If service moves to production URL, configuration change required.

2. **Appwrite Schema Pre-existence**: Collection default.lesson_diagrams already exists with appropriate attributes (lessonTemplateId string, cardId string, jsxgraph_json string, image_base64 string, diagram_type string, visual_critique_score number, critique_iterations number, critique_feedback JSON). If collection doesn't exist, system throws exception (no auto-creation).

3. **Image Storage Strategy**: Base64 images stored inline in Appwrite documents. For typical mathematical diagrams (50-200KB PNG), this fits within 5MB Appwrite document size limit. If future diagrams exceed 1MB, consider migration to cloud storage (AWS S3) with URL references.

4. **Quality Threshold Constant**: Acceptance threshold â‰¥0.85 is fixed based on LangGraph implementation precedent. If curriculum requirements change, threshold becomes configurable parameter.

5. **Refinement Iteration Limit**: Maximum 3 attempts per diagram is industry standard for LLM refinement loops. Prevents infinite loops while allowing reasonable improvement cycles.

6. **Cost Calculation Model**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 pricing ($3/M input tokens, $15/M output tokens) as of January 2025. If model or pricing changes, CostTracker requires update.

7. **Batch Processing Scale**: System designed for courses with up to 50 lessons. For larger courses (100+ lessons), consider adding progress indicators and chunked processing.

8. **Scottish Visual Guidelines**: Diagrams use predefined color palette (Primary Blue #0066CC, Success Green #28a745, Warning Orange #FFA500, Danger Red #DC3545, Neutral Gray #6c757d) consistent with Scottish educational standards.

9. **Card Eligibility Heuristics**: System identifies diagram needs based on cardType and content keywords (mathematical terms, geometric references, data visualization mentions). If heuristics miss edge cases, manual curation required.

10. **Workspace Persistence Default**: Workspaces preserved by default (persist=True) for debugging and audit trail. Production automation should use --no-persist-workspace to avoid disk accumulation.

## Out of Scope

- Diagram editing UI for manual refinement after generation
- Batch processing parallelization (sequential processing only in MVP)
- Cloud storage integration for large images (inline base64 only)
- Diagram versioning system (overwrites only, no history)
- Real-time preview of diagrams during generation (fire-and-forget API model)
- Custom quality threshold configuration (fixed at 0.85)
- Diagram type classification beyond geometry/algebra/statistics
- Integration with LangGraph-based diagram agent (Claude-only implementation)
- Frontend component for diagram browsing/management
- Diagram export to SVG/PDF formats (PNG only)
