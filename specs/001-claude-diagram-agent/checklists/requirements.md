# Specification Quality Checklist: Claude Diagram Generation Agent

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Constitution Compliance

- [x] All requirements follow fast-fail principles (FR-003, FR-012, FR-039, FR-040, FR-047, FR-058, FR-078)
- [x] Code quality constraints specified (FR-085, FR-086, FR-087, FR-088)
- [x] Error handling requirements mandate detailed logging and exceptions (FR-073 through FR-078)
- [x] No fallback patterns or silent failures permitted

## Notes

### Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All checklist items validated

**Detailed Assessment**:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written in user-centric language describing diagram generation workflows for curriculum developers. No Python/Claude SDK/HTTP details appear in requirements. All four mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Key Entities) are fully completed.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 88 functional requirements use precise language with clear testability criteria. Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - all ambiguities resolved through informed assumptions (documented in Assumptions section). Success criteria are measured in minutes, percentages, and Boolean outcomes (100% success rate, ≤5% margin, etc.) with no technology references.

3. **Feature Readiness**: Four prioritized user stories (P1-P4) are independently testable. Each story includes "Why this priority" and "Independent Test" sections demonstrating standalone value delivery. Edge cases cover 10 distinct failure scenarios. All functional requirements map to user story acceptance scenarios.

4. **Constitution Compliance**: Fast-fail principle enforced in 7 explicit requirements (FR-003, FR-012, FR-039, FR-040, FR-047, FR-058, FR-078 all mandate exceptions with "no fallback"). Code quality limits (500 lines, 50 lines) specified in FR-085 through FR-088. Error logging requirements (FR-073 through FR-076) mandate detailed context and stack traces.

**Specification Quality**: The spec achieves a strong balance between:
- **Comprehensiveness**: 88 requirements organized into 11 logical categories
- **Clarity**: Each requirement uses "System MUST" with specific, testable criteria
- **Business Focus**: Written for curriculum coordinators and developers (non-technical audience)
- **Constitution Alignment**: Explicit references to fast-fail, code quality, and error handling principles

**Ready for Planning Phase**: Specification provides sufficient detail for `/speckit.plan` without prescribing implementation (no class structures, no async/await patterns, no API contracts).

### Observations

**Strengths**:
- Prioritized user stories enable incremental delivery (P1 MVP, P2 scale, P3 quality, P4 UX)
- Comprehensive edge case analysis (10 scenarios covering service failures, data issues, resource limits)
- Detailed entity definitions clarify data model without database schema
- Clear scope boundaries (Out of Scope section prevents scope creep)

**Informed Assumptions** (no clarification needed):
- DiagramScreenshot service URL (http://localhost:3001) - standard local development pattern
- Quality threshold (≥0.85) - inherited from LangGraph precedent
- Refinement iterations (max 3) - industry standard for LLM loops
- Image storage (inline base64) - fits within Appwrite 5MB document limit for typical diagrams (50-200KB)
- Scottish color palette - predefined educational standards
- Batch scale (up to 50 lessons) - common course size in target domain

**Next Phase Requirements**:
- `/speckit.plan` should elaborate implementation patterns (Claude SDK usage, workspace structure, Appwrite queries)
- `/speckit.tasks` will break down into actionable stories following P1→P2→P3→P4 sequence
- Testing should validate success criteria measurements (5-minute generation time, ≥90% acceptance rate, etc.)
