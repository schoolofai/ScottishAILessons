## Brand Story

### Origin Narrative
Scottish AI Lessons was born from a simple observation: Scottish students deserve AI-powered education that actually understands their curriculum. While global platforms offer generic content and private tutors charge premium rates, there was no accessible, intelligent, Scotland-specific learning platform.

We combined official SQA curriculum data with cutting-edge LangGraph AI technology to create adaptive lessons that feel like having a personal tutor—but available 24/7, accessible to all learners, and aligned precisely with what students need to succeed in their National qualifications.

Built with teachers, tested by students, and grounded in learning science, Scottish AI Lessons represents the future of education: personalized, accessible, and proudly Scottish.
